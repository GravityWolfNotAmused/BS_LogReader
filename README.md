# BS_LogReader

### This was created to read the script.log file as you are working on DayZ SA scripts/server.
#### There is no need to close the Java application, it will continuously read the file as long as it's not removed from the system.
#### All you need to do is put the location of the your script.log file into the config.txt file
### If you do not see config.txt, one will be created after first run if one was not provided for you.
