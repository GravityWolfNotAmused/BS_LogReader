# BS_LogReader

### This was created to read the script.log file as you are working on DayZ SA scripts/server.
#### There is no need to close the Java application, it will continuously read the file as long as it's not removed from the system.
#### All you need to do is put the location of the your script.log file into the config.txt file
### If you do not see config.txt, one will be created after first run if one was not provided for you.

This can be used to read multiple files with different window instances. Simply change config.txt to have the first path, than change the config.txt and launch the second window. I will later add the ability to just add them to the same config.txt, but for now it's better than opening the script.log file thousand times.
